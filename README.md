polyfit.js
============

Polynomial fitment solver library for node.js

Heavily, heavily inspired by Paul Lutus (lutusp@arachnoid.com) - http://www.arachnoid.com/polysolve
This was just a way to node-ize / component-ize this library, and format it a little better.

Usage
============

To get a polynomial function that you can pass an x value into
and get the corresponding y value (the parameter is the number of degrees)

```javascript

  var Polyfit = require('polyfit');
  var poly = new Polyfit([ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ], [ 0.01, 0.03, -0.02, 0.03, 0.02 ]);
  var solver = poly.getPolynomial(6);
```

Solver will be a function that you can call with an x value.

```javascript

  console.log(solver(1.17));
```

Computing coefficient terms:

```javascript

  var terms = poly.computeCoefficients(6);
```

Use those terms to get a standard error:

```javascript

  var standardError = poly.standardError(terms);
```

Or to get a correlation coefficient

```javascript

  var cc = poly.correlationCoefficient(terms);
```
